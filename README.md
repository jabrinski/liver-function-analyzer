# Liver Function Analyzer

This open-source tool helps visualize trends in liver-related health markers such as ALT, AST, and GGT. It is designed for wellness-focused individuals, self-trackers, and health researchers who want to explore their own data or case studies around liver function.

## About This Project

The Liver Function Analyzer includes:
- A simple Python script to calculate an average "Liver Wellness Score"
- Documentation covering key markers like ALT, AST, and GGT
- A knowledge file discussing liver detoxification and fat metabolism
- Sample data and guides for tracking liver metrics over time

Some users choose to monitor changes in these biomarkers when adjusting lifestyle, diet, or when trying metabolic support supplements.

## Why Liver Function Matters

The liver plays a central role in:
- Fat metabolism
- Detoxification
- Hormonal balance
- Blood sugar regulation
- Nutrient conversion

Emerging research suggests liver function may directly impact energy levels, fat storage, and metabolic rate.

## Liver Markers Tracked

The included script uses three common blood markers:

- **ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)**
- **AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)**
- **GGT (Gamma-glutamyl transferase)**

These values are averaged to produce a basic trend score. This is *not* a medical measurement — it's a simple wellness tracker.

## Exploring Liver Support Strategies

In the `docs/liver_health.md` file, we include educational content on:

- Nutritional liver support
- Lifestyle interventions
- Commonly used herbs (Milk Thistle, Dandelion Root, Turmeric)
- Case studies of metabolic response to liver-focused supplements

As one example, some users explore products like [HepatoBurn](https://tinyurl.com/fpj98van) — a blend of natural ingredients traditionally used to support liver function and metabolic balance.

## How to Use the Script

Navigate to `main.py` and enter your ALT, AST, and GGT levels from a recent blood panel.

Example:
```bash
python3 main.py
